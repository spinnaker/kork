TODO. Where to even begin?

- How plugins are loaded
- How versions are resolved
- How plugin extensions are promoted
- Basics of PF4J (class loaders, etc)
- UpdateRepository schema
- Value of front50 as an update repository
- SDKs
- Configs
- Remote extensions
- Events
- Finders & PluginRef
- ...etc?
