/**
 * Defines the interface for classes that know to supply class data for a class name.
 * The idea is to have the possibility to retrieve the data for a class from different sources:
 *
 *  * Class path - the class is already loaded by the class loader
 *  * String - the string (the source code) is compiled dynamically via [javax.tools.JavaCompiler]>
 *  * Generate the source code programmatically using something like `https://github.com/square/javapoet`
