/**
 * The [UnsafePluginClassLoader] allows a plugin to use the parent classloader. Caution should
 * be used while developing unsafe plugins, as they are given carte blanche integration into
 * the parent application.
 *
 * PF4J is a little wonky in that all class loaders must be a [PluginClassLoader]... so this extends
 * that class, and then just delegates everything to the provided [parent] [ClassLoader]. It's a little
 * wasteful, but the only way to do things and stay in the PF4J ecosystem at the moment.
